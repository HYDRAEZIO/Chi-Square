# Chi-Square

<h3>What is Chi-Square Test?</h3> 
A chi-squared test (symbolically represented as χ2) is basically a data analysis on the basis of observations of a random set of variables.<br>
Usually, it is a comparison of two statistical data sets. This test was introduced by Karl Pearson in 1900 for categorical data analysis <br>
and distribution. So it was mentioned as Pearson’s chi-squared test.

<h3>How do you calculate chi squared?</h3>

The value of the Chi-squared statistic can be calculated using the formula given below:
χ^2 = ∑(O_i – E_i)^2/E_i
This can be done as follows.
For each observed number in the data, subtract the corresponding expected value, i.e. (O — E).
Square the difference, (O — E)^2
Divide these squares by the expected value of each observation, i.e. [(O – E)^2 / E].
Finally, take the sum of these values.
Thus, the obtained value will be the chi-squared statistic.
